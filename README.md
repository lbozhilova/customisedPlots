# Customised plots using ggplot2

Code to go with [this post on BLOPIG](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2019/11/consistent-plotting-with-ggplot/).

The file [masterTheme.R](https://github.com/lbozhilova/customisedPlots/blob/master/masterTheme.R) contains my theme setup, colour palettes and function for arranging plots.

Figures from the blog post were generated using [blopigExamples.R](https://github.com/lbozhilova/customisedPlots/blob/master/blopigExamples.R).
